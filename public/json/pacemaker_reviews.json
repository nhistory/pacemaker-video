They took the time to truly listen to what I was struggling with and offered advice that was practical and meaningful to my situation. What stood out the most was how they didn‚Äôt pretend to have all the answers, but instead shared what they had learned from their own experience and how they would approach things if they were in my shoes. That perspective really helped me see things more clearly and gave me the motivation to move forward. I appreciate the honest, thoughtful guidance. It made a real difference for me."

During the talk, he mentioned, \"Take time to go on a date with yourself and your questions,\" and it resonated deeply with me. When it comes to crafting a resume or networking, the key is figuring out how to express yourself. And to do that, you first need to truly understand who you are. Although it was a short session, his impactful messages left a deep impression on me.\n\nRalph goes beyond simply giving advice‚Äîhe shares realistic and inspiring stories based on his rich experiences. I was especially moved by how he focused on what he could do in the moment from a young age, gaining diverse experiences, and eventually working toward bigger dreams.\n\nHis meticulous and sincere approach makes him an invaluable resource for anyone grappling with career challenges. I highly recommend Ralph's talks at Pacemaker! üòä"

I wanted to thank you for sharing such meaningful words!\n\nPersonally, I think it would be great if events like this were held several times a year to support working holiday participants in their 20s and 30s. These gatherings can give us strength and help us spread positive influence, not only in Korea but also in the wider world.\n\nThe seminar was more than just local leaders giving speeches. It was an opportunity to gain strength by seeing people who have faced and overcome many hardships and challenges, becoming the role models they are today. I could also feel the pure passion of the leaders wanting to support us, which gave me a lot of encouragement.\n\nI believe many other working holiday participants also felt supported by this event, especially since most of us came here alone or experienced being far from family for the first time. Thank you for creating such a meaningful moment!"

He was incredibly supportive, attentive, patient and encouraging from the start and really pushed me to believe in myself. He provided me with helpful tips and excellent strategies to succeed in the interview and boosted my confidence. I am extremely grateful for his help. He is an excellent mentor for anyone who wants to develop their interview skills to land their dream job. I would highly recommend him to anyone who needs help with mock interview and resume.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:\n\nI'd like to start this review/feedback by thanking Ralph, William, and Linda for giving me this opportunity to be part of the webinar today. I was truly lucky to be able to learn something valuable. From how to write an appealing resume (and that you shouldn't be using the same generic resume over and over...which I shouldn't be doing anymore haha) to how to approach a job interview, best practices for behavioral questions, and why you should be confident and ready to sell yourself, there were so many important tips that I made three full pages of note. Because I have an unexpected interview scheduled which aligns with my pre-planned travel, I was naturally stressed and anxious about it; but thanks to their help and thoughtful advice, I'm confident that I'll and I should do my best to prepare for the interview and ace it. Reach out to them if you need any help getting a job. It's never too late!"

We talked for about an hour over the phone, and throughout the session, he was very compassionate and understanding about my current situation and the problems I'm facing. He also provided brief yet detailed steps and advice regarding the choices I can make right now, my future career, and current opportunities.\n\nMoreover, based on what Ralph shared, he and his team at Pacemaker have a solid group of talented mentors and instructors working in various sectors of the industry and organizations. These professionals can help guide you to find and succeed in your own career path. Ralph also strongly emphasized that more people who are struggling with finding a job, planning their careers, or even facing difficulties in life should reach out to him or his team, so they can help as many people as possible.\n\nAfter watching Ralph's KCWA lecture through an acquaintance, we set up a meeting. Ralph contacted me and we had a consultation over the phone today for about an hour. We had an honest conversation about the difficulties and problems I was currently experiencing. Ralph also seems to have gone through a lot of trial and error to get to where he is today, so the words he said throughout the consultation touched my heart even more. Ralph and the mentors and guides at Pacemaker are people who work in a variety of fields, so I think they will be very helpful to those who are having difficulty finding a job. Lastly, Ralph said that he would like to help many people who are having difficulty finding a job or are in a bad situation so that they do not go through the same trial and error as he did, so if you think you are one of these people, I strongly recommend that you do not worry and contact Pacemaker for consultation."

If you are experiencing any difficulties, I recommend that you receive comfort and courage through the CEO's lecture!"

It was a precious time where I was able to learn skills about my 'career' that I had never learned while growing up in Korea, things I need to know to appeal to Canadian society, and things I need to think about at least once. I think people in their 20s and 30s who are spending their youth in Canada should definitely listen to CEO Lee Woo-seop's lecture at least once. I was able to gain the strength to endure the dark and frustrating days right now. I was grateful to hear the good energy and words. ^^"

In particular, they provide consulting that matches the latest trends and various tips that fit the position. And through consistent meetings and multiple revisions, you can write a resume and cover letter that will continue to improve! They also guide and support you in preparing for interviews and other preparations necessary for employment, which is reassuring. I really recommend it to those who are looking for a job in Canada for the first time :)"

    "content": "While I was preparing for a job change, I had a lot of failures in the third and final interview, so my confidence in interviewing was very low. At that time, there was an interview interview seminar hosted by Ralph and Kevin's presentation, and I attended it. The tips I got from that time and the mock interview I had were really helpful in my success with this job change.\nI also received brief Resume consulting from the mentor (park) that Ralph connected me to. Based on the comment from the mentor that all the bullet points were too generic, I specified detailed numbers, percentages, etc. for each item. We have continuously developed Resume in this direction.\nI believe that all of this build-up has helped me succeed in changing jobs to where I am today :) Thank you so much for allowing me to receive valuable help, Mr. Ralph „Ö†.„Ö†"

When I didn't know where to start, he gave me ideas that I could start with in a short period of time. He also really enjoys this work, so I can get sincere advice. Also, I was able to awaken the essence of job search preparation that I had forgotten through YouTube videos. Especially, the session with Ralph was very helpful to me who was preparing an English resume for the first time."
